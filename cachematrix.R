## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. For that
## we'll use the following two functions:

## This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
